# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install different versions of packages depending
#   on the platform. Pipfile.lock may vary on different platforms. For example, on Windows,
#   pywin32 may be installed as a dependency.
#   In that case, it may be better to ignore Pipfile.lock since it platform-specific.
#   Hence, Pipfile.lock is included here as a commented out entry.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   The reasoning behind this is the same as for Pipfile.lock.
#   poetry.lock may be platform-specific when dependencies do not have cross-platform support.
#   Again, it is included here as a commented out entry.
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores its virtual environment in .pdm-python, which should be ignored.
